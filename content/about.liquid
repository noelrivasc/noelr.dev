				I'm Noel, a software designer and developer. I've spent 20 years building web applications—maps, knowledge bases, wizards and databases—primarily for nonprofits working in climate, conservation, and human rights.
			</p>
			<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle leading-relaxed">
				I studied Industrial Design, worked as a web designer for years, then moved into full-stack development. For a decade, I led technical strategy at my own consultancy, Matrushka. I then joined Summit Digital Group where I served as tech lead on projects in the health services space.

			Why work with me?
		</h2>

		<div class="max-w-3xl space-y-4">
			<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle leading-relaxed">
				<strong>You get a single point of contact with deep expertise</strong>. I studied Industrial Design, then spent years as a web designer before moving into software engineering 20 years ago. I combine design thinking with technical execution so there's no coordination overhead and no vision dilution between teams.
			</p>

			<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle leading-relaxed">
				<strong>I build only what you need</strong>. Sometimes I'll push back on adding features. Complexity is easy to add but hard to remove. My job is to keep your project focused, maintainable, and successful —not to maximize billable hours.
			</p>

			<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle leading-relaxed">
				<strong>I've solved similar problems before</strong>. Maps, wizards, case management systems, evaluation platforms, knowledge bases, visualizations, digital archives, resource centers. Every project is different, but the principles for success stay consistent.
			</p>

			<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle leading-relaxed">
				<strong>I work with modern, proven technologies</strong> and partner with specialists when projects need deep expertise in areas like visual branding or performance optimization.
