# Work Values

There's more than technical skills. The success and ease of our collaboration hinges on the shared ability to communicate, make plans and deliver on them.

## Seek Joyful Collaboration

Sometimes projects flow super nicely; sometimes they get hard. Regardless of the situation, seeking joyful collaboration and tackling things together makes work feel much nicer. Let's do that.

## Clear Process, Proactive Communication

Software development projects can be complex, involve multiple stakeholders and feel like cat herding.

Here's what I do to keep the process from being overwhelming:

- Work with you to set goals, success criteria and identify risks. Then, follow up on those criteria so you always know where we are and where we are headed.
- Keep the technical complexity low. The less moving parts there are, the less there will be to maintain and fix.
- I help all stakeholders to understand the project from their perspective, without needless technical jargon.

## I Know What You're Talking About

Chances are, I'll understand you without much explaining. I'm proactive in researching your domain's context and language so we can have the most productive and enjoyable conversations.

## Simpler is Better

Rather than driving projects to towards complicated solutions, I seek to come up with the most efficient, easy to maintain ones. The easiest code to maintain is the one whose writing is avoided in the first place.
