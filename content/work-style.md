# Work Style

There's more than technical skills. The success and ease of our collaboration hinges on the shared ability to communicate, make plans and deliver on them.

## Seek Joyful Collaboration

Sometimes projects flow super nicely; sometimes they get hard. Regardless of the situation, seeking joyful collaboration and tackling things together makes work feel much nicer. Let's do that.

## Clear Process, Proactive Communication

Software development projects can be complex, involve multiple stakeholders and feel like cat herding. 

Here's what I do to keep the process from being overwhelming:

- Work with you to set goals, success criteria and identify risks. Then, follow up on those criteria so you always know where we are and where we are headed.
- Keep the technical complexity low. The less moving parts there are, the less there will be to maintain and fix.
- I help all stakeholders to understand the project from their perspective, without needless technical jargon.

## I Know What You're Talking About
Chances are, I'll get your needs or situation without much explaining. No need to explain SDGs, Kyoto or COP; for things that need explaining, I'm proactive in learning your context and language so we can have the most productive and enjoyable conversations.

## Simpler is Better

Rather than driving projects to towards complicated solutions, I seek to come up with the most efficient, easy to maintain ones. The easiest code to maintain is the one whose writing is avoided in the first place.
