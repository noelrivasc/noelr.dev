						Clarity Workshop
					</h2>

					<p class="font-thin text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
						Your software project is stuck, fuzzy, or heading in a direction you're not sure about. You need answers before you can move forward confidently.
					</p>

					<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle mb-4">
						Maybe you have an idea but aren't sure it's feasible. Maybe you have wireframes but no clear path to implement them. Or development's already underway but something's gone wrong.
					</p>

					<ul class="font-thin space-y-3 text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle mb-6">
						<li class="flex items-start">
							<span class="mr-3">•</span>
							<span>You have an idea but don't know if it's feasible or how to present it.</span>

						<li class="flex items-start">
							<span class="mr-3">•</span>
							<span>Development is underway but something's gone wrong: disagreement with your agency, a handoff that isn't working, technical decisions you can't evaluate.</span>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle mb-4">
					In a few focused conversations, I review your situation through a product, design, and engineering lens. I then give you a clear picture of where you are, what's actually going on, and what to do next.
					</p>

					<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle my-4">
						No fluff, zero AI slop: you just get distilled clarity you can act on immediately. You own this document and can use it with any team.
					</p>

					<p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle my-4">
						The whole process takes about a week. Expect 3-4 hours of your time.
					</p>

						<ol class="font-thin space-y-3 text-base md:text-lg text-body-subtle mt-3 list-decimal pl-6">
							<li><span class="text-body">Short call (15-30 min, free)</span>. You tell me what's going on. We identify your key questions and decide if we're a good fit.</li>
							<li><span class="text-body">Deep-dive meeting</span>. You get a brief guide beforehand so you come prepared. I learn your project in detail —goals, constraints, what's been tried, what's not working.</li>
							<li><span class="text-body">I dig into your materials</span>. I review what you've provided —wireframes, designs, code, specs— looking for answers to your questions and problems you might not see yet. If I need input from someone on your team, we schedule a short call.</li>
							<li><span class="text-body">Findings meeting</span>. I walk you through what I found and what I recommend. You leave with clear next steps.</li>
						</ol>

						Price: $2,500. If you finish the workshop and don't feel the clarity you gained was worth it, you get a full refund.
