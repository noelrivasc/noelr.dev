	<p>Hi! I'm Noel Rivas</p>
	<p>I collaborate with companies and organizations addressing climate change.</p>
	<p>I've been writing software for 20 years, and started my career earlier as a designer.</p>
</div>

<p>I've led and worked hands-on on dozens of projects for over 20 national, regional and global organizations, including IUCN, People Powered and National Fund for the Conservation of Nature (in Mexico).</p>

<h2>How can all of this help you?</h2>

<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li>I know what you're talking about </li>
	<li>Clear process, proactive communication</li>
	<li>Strong software development skills</li>
</ul>

<h3>I know that you're talking about</h3>
Chances are, I'll get your needs or situation without much explaining. No need to explain SDGs, Kyoto or COP; and for things that need explaining, I'll get up to speed in no time.

<h3>Clear process, proactive communication</h3>
<p>Software development projects can be complex, involve multiple stakeholders and feel like cat herding. </p>
<p>To keep the process from being overwhelming, I:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Work with you to set goals, success criteria and identify risks. Then, follow up on those criteria so you always know where we are and where we are headed.</li>
	<li>Keep the technical complexity low. The less moving parts there are, the less there will be to maintain and fix.</li>
	<li>I help all stakeholders to understand the project from their perspective, without needless technical jargon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strong software development skills</h3>
<p>I'm comfortable in the TypeScript, JavaScript and PHP ecosystems. I've developed CMS - based websites, databases, mobile and web-based apps.</p>
<p>In addition to those, I've put together a rich toolkit that includes other languages and tools I can draw from to design the simplest, most reliable solutions.</p>
