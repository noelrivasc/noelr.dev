# Technical Skills

You want your software to be flexible so you can adapt quickly, but stable so you can build on it as you grow.

I have 20+ years of experience in software development, and 10+ of leading teams.

In this time, I've acquired the tools and intuition to plan and steward software development projects to strike a balance between stability and flexibility.

## Stakeholder Communication

While these are non-coding skills, they are essential to the success of a project:

- Design and architecture. While agile and iteration are great, some planning and forethought are essential to avoid ending up with entangled code that eventually hinders progress.
- Acting as communication bridge between developers and non-technical stakeholders, bringing clarity to both sides, in their own language.
- Helping non-technical stakeholders understand options and tradeoffs, and to contribute to technical decisions.

## Types of Products

I've developed web-based and mobile apps, databases, GIS and content management systems.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

AWS, shell scripting, Docker, process automation, GitHub actions, DDEV.

The use of these tools to make the development and deployment process repeatable, stable and predictable leads to easier testing, improved developer performance and reduced human error.

## Languages & Frameworks

I'm at home with TypeScript, JavaScript, NodeJS and PHP ecosystems. I've done some Ruby, Python and, more recently, Clojure and ClojureScript. SQL either with MySQL or PostgreSQL are daily drivers.

At the framework level: React, React Native, VueJS, Express, Serverless Framework, Laravel, Drupal, LeafletJS.

## Drupal

I have over 20 years of experience with Drupal and have used it to build sites for organizations such as IUCN and the Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature.

## UX + AI

While I haven't shipped software that makes use of AI models, I see promise in using them to fix impedance mismatches and to facilitate climate action coordination.
