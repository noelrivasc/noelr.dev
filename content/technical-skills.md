# Technical Skills

I'm comfortable in the TypeScript, JavaScript, NodeJS and PHP ecosystems. I've developed CMS - based websites, databases, mobile and web-based apps. I've done some Ruby, Python and, more recently, Clojure and ClojureScript.

Some of the tools and frameworks I've used substantially are Serverless Framework, Laravel, React Native, VueJS, Drupal, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB, various AWS services, and LeafletJS.

Other standards like git, GitHub, Linux, shell scripts, linters, build tools and the like are part of my workflow.

One tends to collect lots of technologies in 20 years of software development. Wondering about some specific not mentioned here? [Drop me a line!](mailto:web@noelr.dev)
